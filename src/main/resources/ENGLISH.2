The American Revolutionary War (1775â€“1783), also known as the American War of Independence and the Revolutionary War in the United
States, was the armed conflict between Great Britain and thirteen of its North American colonies, which had declared themselves
the independent United States of America. Early fighting took place primarily on the North American continent. In 1778, France,
eager for revenge after its defeat in the Seven Years' War, signed an alliance with the new nation. The conflict then expanded
into a world war with Britain combating France, Spain, and the Netherlands. Fighting also broke out in India between the British
East India Company and the French allied Kingdom of Mysore. The American Revolutionary War had its origins in the resistance of
many Americans to taxes, which they claimed were unconstitutional, imposed by the British parliament. Patriot protests escalated
into boycotts, and on December 16, 1773, the destruction of a shipment of tea at the Boston Tea Party. The British government
punished Massachusetts by closing the port of Boston and taking away self-government. The Patriots responded by setting up a
shadow government that took control of the province outside of Boston. Twelve other colonies supported Massachusetts, formed a
Continental Congress to coordinate their resistance, and set up committees and conventions that effectively seized power from the
royal governments. In April 1775 fighting broke out between Massachusetts militia units and British regulars at Lexington and
Concord. The Continental Congress appointed General George Washington to take charge of militia units besieging British forces in
Boston, forcing them to evacuate the city in March 1776. Congress supervised the war, giving Washington command of the new
Continental Army; he also coordinated state militia units. On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress formally voted for
independence, and issued its Declaration on July 4. The British were meanwhile mustering forces to suppress the revolt. Sir
William Howe outmaneuvered and defeated Washington, capturing New York City and New Jersey. Washington was able to capture a
Hessian detachment at Trenton and drive the British out of most of New Jersey. In 1777 Howe's army launched a campaign against the
national capital at Philadelphia, failing to aid Burgoyne's separate invasion force from Canada. Burgoyne's army was trapped, and
surrendered after the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777. This American victory encouraged France to enter the war in 1778,
followed by its ally Spain in 1779. In 1778, having failed in the northern states, the British shifted strategy toward the
southern colonies, where they planned to enlist many Loyalist regiments. British forces had initial success in bringing Georgia
and South Carolina under control in 1779 and 1780, but the Loyalist surge was far weaker than expected. In 1781 British forces
moved through Virginia, but their escape was blocked by a French naval victory. Washington took control of a Franco-American siege
at Yorktown and captured the entire British force of over 7,000 men. The defeat at Yorktown finally turned the British Parliament
against the war, and in early 1782 they voted to end offensive operations in North America. The war against France and Spain
continued however, with the British defending Gibraltar against a long running Franco-Spanish siege, while the British navy scored
key victories, especially the Battle of the Saintes in 1782. In 1783, the Treaty of Paris ended the war and recognized the
sovereignty of the United States over the territory bounded roughly by what is now Canada to the north, Florida to the south, and
the Mississippi River to the west. France gained its revenge and little else except a heavy national debt, while Spain acquired
Great Britain's Florida colonies. The close of the Seven Years' War in 1763 (called the French and Indian War in America) saw
Great Britain triumphant in driving the French from North America. London decided to pension many officers on half pay and require
the American colonies to pay for them. Parliament passed the Stamp Act in March 1765, which imposed direct taxes on the colonies
for the first time starting November 1. This was met with strong condemnation among American spokesmen, who argued that their
"Rights as Englishmen" meant that taxes could not be imposed on them because they lacked representation in Parliament. At the same
time the colonists rejected the solution of being provided with the representation, claiming that "their local circumstances" made
it impossible. Civil resistance prevented the Act from being enforced, and organized boycotts of British goods were instituted.
This resistance was by and large unexpected and "produced a violent and very natural irritation." A change of government in
Britain led to the repeal of the Stamp Act as inexpedient, but also the passage of the Declaratory Act, which stated, "the said
colonies and plantations in America have been, are, and of right ought to be, subordinate unto, and dependent upon the imperial
crown and parliament of Great Britain." In their declarations Americans had deemed internal taxes like the Stamp Act as unlawful,
but not external taxes like custom duties. In 1767 Parliament passed the Townshend Act in order to demonstrate its supremacy. It
imposed duties on various British goods exported to the colonies. The Americans quickly denounced this as illegal as well, since
the intent of the act was to raise revenue and not regulate trade. In 1768 violence broke out in Boston over attempts to suppress
smuggling and 4000 British troops were sent to occupy the city. Parliament threatened to try Massachusetts residents for treason
in England. Far from being intimidated, the colonists formed new associations to boycott British goods, albeit with less
effectiveness than previously since the Townshend imports were so widely used. In March 1770 five colonists in Boston were killed
in the "Boston Massacre", sparking outrage. In 1773, in an effort to rescue the East India Company from financial difficulties,
the government attempted to increase the company's tea sales by exempting it from the tea tax (reducing the price of its tea) and
appointing certain merchants in America to receive and sell it. The landing of this tea was resisted in all the colonies and, when
the royal governor of Massachusetts refused to send back the tea ships in Boston, Patriots destroyed the tea chests.

The War of 1812 was a military conflict, lasting for two and a half years, fought by the United States of America against the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, its North American colonies and its Native American allies. Seen by the United States
and Canada as a war in its own right, it is frequently seen in Europe as a theatre of the Napoleonic Wars, as it was caused by
issues related to that war (especially the Continental System). The war resolved many issues which remained from the American
Revolutionary War but involved no boundary changes. The United States declared war on June 18, 1812, for several reasons,
including trade restrictions brought about by the British war with France, the impressment of US merchant sailors into the Royal
Navy, British support for Native American tribes against European American expansion, outrage over insults to national honor after
humiliations on the high seas, and possible US interest in annexing British territory. The war was fought in three theatres.
First, at sea, warships and privateers of each side attacked the other's merchant ships, while the British blockaded the Atlantic
coast of the United States and mounted large raids in the later stages of the war. Second, land and naval battles were fought on
the US–Canadian frontier. Third, large-scale battles were fought in the Southern United States and Gulf Coast. At the end of the
war, both sides signed and ratified the Treaty of Ghent and, in accordance with the treaty, returned occupied land, prisoners of
war and captured warships (though neither side returned the other's warships due to frequent re-commissioning upon capture) to its
pre-war owner and resumed friendly trade relations without restriction. With the majority of its land and naval forces tied down
in Europe fighting the Napoleonic Wars, the British used a predominately defensive strategy in the Provinces of Upper and Lower
Canada, although the first engagement of the war was a failed British offensive on New York. Early victories over poorly-led US
armies, such as in the Battle of Queenston Heights, demonstrated that the conquest of the Canadas would prove more difficult than
anticipated. Despite this, the US was able to inflict serious defeats on Britain's Native American allies, ending the prospect of
an Indian confederacy and an independent Native American state in the Midwest under British sponsorship. US forces were also able
to make several gains and score victories on the Canadian frontier; taking control of Lake Erie in 1813 and seizing western parts
of Upper Canada. However, a large-scale US attempt to capture Montreal was repulsed in November 1813. Despite the major US victory
at Chippawa on July 5, 1814, serious US attempts to fully conquer Upper Canada were ultimately abandoned following the bloody
Battle of Lundy's Lane on July 25, 1814. The US then fell back roughly 30 km (18 mi) from Lundy's Lane to Fort Erie, where they
were pursued by the same units they engaged at Lundy's Lane. The intention of the British was to "drive them [the Americans] from
the Canadian side of the Niagara." It turned out to be the final major battle fought on the Canadian side of the Canadian-American
border (the last taking place at Malcolm's Mills), ending in a retreat by both sides - with the British being ordered to move
their artillery and troops back to Fort George near Lundy's Lane in Niagara Falls "as soon as possible" and the Americans
abandoning the fort and withdrawing over the Niagara. In April 1814, with the defeat of Napoleon, the British adopted a more
aggressive strategy, sending larger invasion armies and tightening their naval blockade. However, with the end of the Napoleonic
Wars in Europe, both governments were eager for a return to normality and peace negotiations began in Ghent in August 1814. In the
Deep South, General Andrew Jackson destroyed the military strength of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend.
In September 1814, the British won the Battle of Hampden, allowing them to occupy eastern Maine, and the British victory at the
Battle of Bladensburg in August 1814 allowed them to capture and burn Washington, D.C.. They were repulsed, however, in an attempt
to take Baltimore and Fort Bowyer, and during their assault at Fayal. An American victory in September 1814 at the Battle of
Plattsburgh repulsed the British invasions of New York, which, along with pressure from merchants on the British government,
prompted British diplomats to drop their demands at Ghent for an independent native buffer state and territorial claims that
London previously sought. Given that it took six weeks for ships to cross the Atlantic, news of the peace treaty did not arrive
before the British suffered a major defeat at New Orleans in January 1815. In the United States, late victories over invading
British armies at the battles of Plattsburg, Baltimore (inspiring their national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner") and New
Orleans produced a sense of euphoria over a "second war of independence" against Britain. The war ended on a high note for
Americans, winning the final engagements of the war and bringing an "Era of Good Feelings" in which partisan animosity nearly
vanished in the face of strengthened American nationalism. The war was also a major turning point in the development of the US
military. The poor performance of several US militia units, particularly during the 1812–13 invasions of Canada and the 1814
defense of Washington, convinced the US government of the need to move away from its Revolutionary-era reliance on militia and
focus on creating a more professional regular force. Spain was involved in fighting in Florida but was not an official
belligerent; some Spanish forces fought alongside the British during the Occupation of Pensacola. The US took permanent ownership
of Spain's Mobile District. In Upper and Lower Canada, British and local Canadian militia victories over invading US armies became
iconic and promoted the development of a distinct Canadian identity, which included strong loyalty to Britain. Today, particularly
in Ontario, memory of the war retains its significance, because the defeat of the invasions ensured that the Canadas would remain
part of the British Empire, rather than be annexed by the United States. In Canada, numerous ceremonies took place in 2012 to
commemorate the war, offer historical lessons and celebrate 200 years of peace across the border. The conflict has not been
commemorated on nearly the same level in the modern-day United States, though it is still taught as an important part of early
American history, and Dolley Madison's and Andrew Jackson's respective roles in the war are especially emphasized. The war is
scarcely remembered in Britain, being heavily overshadowed by the much larger Napoleonic Wars occurring in Europe.

As a result of the war, Iraq held multi-party elections in 2005. Nouri al-Maliki became Prime Minister in 2006 and remained
in office until 2014. The Maliki government enacted policies that were widely seen as 
having the effect of alienating the country's Sunni minority and worsening sectarian tensions. 
In the summer of 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) launched a military offensive in Northern Iraq and
declared a worldwide Islamic caliphate, eliciting another military response from the United States and its allies. 
The Iraq War caused hundreds of thousands of civilian, and thousands of military casualties (see estimates below). 
The majority of casualties occurred as a result of the insurgency and civil conflicts between 2004 and 2007.
